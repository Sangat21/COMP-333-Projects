Final Assignment

The final assignment requires you to:

Select any program you've ever written which is at least 100 lines long. You must be able to send its source code to me. You may select a prior assignment in this course.
Write an equivalent program in a language of your choosing which we did not cover in class (e.g., no JavaScript, Swift, Prolog, or Rust).
The intention with this assignment is to gain experience with a completely new language. Languages come and go rapidly, and so being able to similarly pick up new languages on the fly is a great skill to have. By reimplementing something you've already worked with, this shows you (presumably) understand the problem to solve, keeping most of the difficulty in the use of the new language itself. Additionally, you may find that the language forces you to think in a different way than you did before; for example, assignments 1 and 2 both implement immutable lists, but they have significantly different implementations in JavaScript and Swift.

You may work in groups of up to three students. For each person in the group, the minimum code size for the original program increases by 100 lines, so a group of three would need a 300 line program minimum.

Different individuals/groups may choose the same language.
