There is only a single big step for this assignment: read chapters 1-5 of the Amzi! Adventure in Prolog Tutorial. This is a relatively short textbook which is freely available online. Links to the individual chapters are on the left side of the screen, below the picture of the flying squirrel (do not ask me why there is a random picture of a flying squirrel there...).


Then Log into Canvas, and go to the COMP 333 class. Click “Assignments” on the left pane, then click “Assignment 4”. From here, you need to upload the following files:

<ul>
<li>2_exercises.pl</li>
<li>3_exercises.pl</li>
<li>4_exercises.pl</li>
<li>5_exercises.pl</li>
    </ul>
In addition, if you collaborated with anyone else, be sure to download collaborators.txt and write the names of the people you collaborated with in the file, one per line. Please submit this file along with the other files.

You can turn in the assignment multiple times, but only the last version you submitted will be graded.
